        <p>Welcome to <span class="app-name">Made in Libya for Manufacturers App</span> (the "App," "we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Creation Information:</strong> We primarily use OAuth (e.g., Sign in with Google) for account creation. Information from the OAuth provider may include your email address and a user identifier.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Email Address (required for app functionality and account management).</li>

                    <li>Photos you upload (e.g., for product listings, profiles; required for app functionality and account management).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>App Activity & Performance Information:</strong>

                </ul>
            </li>

        <p>We do not knowingly collect other sensitive personal information unless directly provided by you for specific app features, and only with your consent where required.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for purposes including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing and maintaining the App, including account creation and management.</li>
            <li>Enabling core app functionalities like product listings, user interactions, and search.</li>
            <li>Monitoring and analyzing usage to improve the App.</li>
            <li>Diagnosing and fixing technical problems.</li>
            <li>Providing users (e.g., manufacturers) with insights and analytics dashboards related to their activity on the App, using their specific data.</li>
            <li>Generating aggregated and anonymized statistical data for internal analysis, platform trends, service improvement, and potentially providing benchmark insights to users. Such aggregated and anonymized data does not identify individual users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We generally do not share your personal information with unrelated third parties for their independent use, except in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User-to-User Visibility:</strong> Certain information you provide (e.g., manufacturer profiles, product listings) will be visible to other App users as part of the App's functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may use third-party service providers (e.g., cloud hosting, analytics, crash reporting) who process your data on our behalf to help us operate and improve the App. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users or the public.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your data may be transferred.</li>
            <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> For any other purpose with your explicit consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aggregated and anonymized data may be used for platform analytics or benchmark insights and is not considered sharing of personal information.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We declare that user data is encrypted in transit. We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information, but no system is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal information as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy, for active accounts, to provide services (including analytics dashboards), or as required by law. Aggregated and anonymized data may be kept for longer periods.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
